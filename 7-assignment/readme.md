# passport-facebook OAuth

In this assignment, we were assigned to authenticate using facebook ID and save the credentials to MongoDB using Mongoose. I build my first app on *Meta for Developers* and got ID and Secret Key on which I worked in thsi app (I have saved those in .env file and git ignored that file ofcourse).

This was one of my favorite assignments so far.
I got to learn many new things like crypto encryption, decryption, jwt-authentication, facebook authentication, sessions, cookies, passport and much more.

It was somehow challenging but more of interesting.
